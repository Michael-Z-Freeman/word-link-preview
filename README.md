Create link previews for Word (.docx)

The preview image shows the docx in Apple Pages where it looks OK. It looks bad in Word but seeing as I don't use word I did not fix it (it's probably easy to fix in Word or in the script).
The project requires a text file "links.txt" with the actual links to create previews from.
The script assumes existence of directories "PREVIEWS/CROPPED" and "HTML".
